1. Download and install the Saints Row 4 Patch for - [LOW SPECS] 64 bit from [this link](https://patronway.com/saints-row-4-patch-for-low-specs-64-bit/). This patch will optimize your game settings and lower the graphics quality to make the game run faster on your PC[^1^].
2. Launch the game and go to the options menu. Disable any unnecessary features such as motion blur, depth of field, ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, etc. You can also lower the resolution and the display mode to windowed or borderless.
3. If you still experience lag or stuttering, you can try editing the config file of the game. Go to your Documents folder and find the Saints Row IV folder. Open the display.ini file with a text editor and change some values according to your preference. For example, you can lower the shadow quality by changing ShadowMapSize=2048 to ShadowMapSize=512. You can also disable some effects by changing EnableFXAA=1 to EnableFXAA=0 or EnableBloom=1 to EnableBloom=0. Save the file and restart the game.
4. Enjoy playing Saints Row 4 on your low spec PC!

Note: These steps are not guaranteed to work for everyone and may cause some graphical glitches or crashes. Use them at your own risk and make sure to backup your files before making any changes.

Saints Row 4 is a game that offers a lot of freedom and creativity to the players. You can customize your character, your weapons, your vehicles, and even your gang. You can also explore the virtual city of Steelport and complete various missions and activities. You can also use your superpowers to jump, glide, run, and blast your way through the enemies.
 
However, some players might find the game too easy or too repetitive after a while. If you want to spice up your gameplay and challenge yourself, you can try some of the cheat codes that are available in the game. Cheat codes are special commands that you can enter in the pause menu to activate or deactivate certain effects. For example, you can make yourself invincible, give yourself unlimited ammo, spawn any vehicle you want, or change the weather.
 
However, be aware that using cheat codes will disable your achievements and autosave. You will also not be able to upload your stats or progress to the online leaderboards. Therefore, use cheat codes only for fun and not for serious gameplay. You can find a list of cheat codes for Saints Row 4 [here](https://www.ign.com/cheats/games/saints-row-iv-pc-14349529).

Saints Row 4 is not only a game that you can play alone, but also with your friends. The game supports co-op mode, which allows you to join another player online and play the entire campaign together. You can also participate in some co-op specific activities and challenges, such as Cat and Mouse, Death Tag, Mech Suit Mayhem, and more. You can also customize your co-op settings, such as friendly fire, voice chat, and vehicle access.
 
Co-op mode is a great way to enjoy the game with someone else and share the fun and madness. You can also help each other out in difficult situations or compete with each other for the best score. However, you will need an internet connection and a Steam account to play co-op mode. You will also need to invite or join another player through the Steam overlay or the in-game menu.
 
Saints Row 4 is a game that has something for everyone. Whether you want to play solo or co-op, use cheat codes or not, customize your gameplay or not, you will always find something new and exciting to do. The game is a blast from start to finish and will keep you entertained for hours. If you have a low spec PC and want to play Saints Row 4, don't let that stop you. Just follow the steps above and enjoy the game!
